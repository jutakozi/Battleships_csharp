This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Battleships game in C#. The game is played on a 10x10 grid, where the player's objective is to sink the battleship by guessing its location.

The battleship is randomly placed on the grid at the start of the game. The player then enters coordinates (row, col) to fire at the battleship. If the player's guess matches the location of the battleship, they win the game. Otherwise, they continue guessing until they hit the battleship.

This implementation is designed to be a minimalistic version of the game, focusing on core gameplay mechanics without any additional features or complexities. It serves as a fun and straightforward introduction to programming concepts such as arrays, loops, and conditional statements in C#.

1. Run the program.
2. Enter coordinates (row, col) to fire at the battleship.
3. Keep guessing until you hit the battleship.
4. Once you hit the battleship, you win!

To enable debug mode, simply write debug while playing.

Have fun playing Battleships!
